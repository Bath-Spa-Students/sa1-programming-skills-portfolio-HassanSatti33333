# Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks
# In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

# Steps:
# Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
# Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
# Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
# Print the value of the sum to the console.

Int_1 = 8                                                            # Declaring a variable with value 8 
Int_2 = 10                                                           # Declaring a variable with value 10 
total = Int_1 + Int_2                                                # Declaring a variable which stores the sum of the first 2 variables

print ( f"The sum of {Int_1} and {Int_2} is {total}")                # Printing the sum of the 2 variables by calling the 3rd variable
